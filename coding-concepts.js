// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:


// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: I think that this will log "10".
// b) Verify and explain: "10" was the generated output. This makes sense because the .length() method counts the number of characters within the string, which also includes spacing between characters.


// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: This will log "o".
// b) Verify and explain: The generated output was "o" because "o" is the 4th character since the index starts at 0 with the letter "H".


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: This will log "Ruby".
// b) Verify and explain: The generated output was "Ruby" because its using the number 1 because 1 is set as the value for the variable index.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: This will log "weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function".
// b) Verify and explain: The generated output was "weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function" because the element isn't specified and the data is within the array.


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: This will log "number".
// b) Verify and explain: The generated output was "number" because the array dataTypes length is a number which is 3 in this case.
