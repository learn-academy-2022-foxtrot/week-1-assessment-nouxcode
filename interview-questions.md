# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: 

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is software thats open-source which allows you to keep track of your source code and GitHub is the cloud service Git repository. GitHub allows for code hosting and collaboration for developers.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system which is open-source and helps you manage the history of your source code, while Github is the cloud hosting service which manages your repositories from Git. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value are logical operators.

Researched answer: ThecJavaScript operators that will return a Boolean values are AND, OR, and NOT. These values are considered logical operators.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The index is the amount of time to skip, counting from the start of an array. Values are basically portions seperate bits of information that play different roles.

Researched answer: The index is the placement of strings and their property length that are accounted for. Strings are considered "zero indexed" therefore the counting of the characters begins with 0 and is counted from there. A value is a chunk of information when you set a variable, it can be any data type and can be changed at any time.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: Arrays are a type of variable that can have multiple values at a time and strings are a series of characters which represent words as opposed to numbers.

Researched answer: The primary difference between an array and a string is that an array is a data structure that contains a collection of elements having the same data types. A String is a collection of textm, words or characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming techniques utilize two primary roles, which are the driver and navigator and incorporate timed breaks to minimize fatigue roughly every 10-25 minutes or so depending on preference and frequently switching roles. The driver is the person designated to write the code while the navigator is an additional set of eyes for catching any errors with the code by reviewing and proofreading. 

Researched answer: A proper pair programming technique that is utilized is known as Pomdoro Pairing. In this method a 25 minute timer is started, one person takes on the role of the driver (person who writes the code) while the other person is designated as the navigator (person reviewing the codes for any errors) and work is conducted until the time runs out. Afterwards the pair takes a 5-10 minute break and then they switch roles so that the person that was previously driving then navigates and vice versa.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher Order functions are functions that operate on other functions by taking them as arguments or by returning them. Higher order functions allow for abstraction over actions and not just values, and they come in several forms. FOr instance, we can have functions which create new functions.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework in JavaScript that allows the user to check the correctness of any codebase in JavaScript. It allows the user to to code and write tests that will generate as pass of fail.

3. Objects: Objects are arbitrary collections of properties, and they are created by using braces as an expression.

4. Method: A method is a property that contains function values. Typically a method needs to do something with the object which it was called on.

5. Classes: Classes define the shape of a type of object and what methods and properties it has.
